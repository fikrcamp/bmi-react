## BMI calculator using React

Calculate the BMI using the formula

> BMI = mass / height \*\* 2

Your Task 😃:
Using your React knowledge so far we want to build a BMI calculator app using React. You will be task to create the components you need as well as design it the way you want.

You are required to create 3 text boxes for the user inputs: 1. Taking the users name 2. Taking the users height 3. Taking the users mass

and you are later required to display the users name, height, mass and total BMI

Good Luck 😀
